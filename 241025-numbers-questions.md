## Ten numbers in world literature
I have removed numbers from the (translated) titles of texts. How many of these works do you know?

This round is deliberately a toughie. I would have known two and guessed one more… but hey, I learnt something by compiling this list; maybe you’ll learn something from considering it.

To help (not much), I’ll tell you that the numbers are all distinct, and they increase as you read down the list.
